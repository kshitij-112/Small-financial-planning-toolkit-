Developing a Simple Financial Planning Toolkit in Java with Mortgage Calculator, Investment Return Calculator, and Savings Goal Calculator involves several steps. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to get you started:

1. Setting Up Your Project
Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
Organize your project into packages (e.g., calculators, models, utils).
2. Creating Models
Mortgage Calculator:

Create a MortgageCalculator class.
Define attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, loan term, etc.
Implement methods to calculate monthly payments, total payments, and amortization schedule if needed.
Investment Return Calculator:

Create an InvestmentCalculator class.
Define attributes like initial investment amount, annual interest rate, investment period, etc.
Implement methods to calculate future value based on different compounding frequencies (monthly, annually, etc.).
Savings Goal Calculator:

Create a SavingsGoalCalculator class.
Define attributes such as current savings, monthly contribution, target amount, interest rate, etc.
Implement methods to calculate how long it will take to reach the savings goal and the total contributions needed.
3. Implementing User Interface (Optional)
You can create a simple command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
Design a menu or separate UI screens for each calculator.
4. Testing
Write unit tests for each calculator to ensure they produce correct results for various input scenarios.
Utilize JUnit or any other testing framework for Java.
5. Integration
Integrate the calculators into your chosen user interface (CLI/GUI).
Ensure the calculators interact correctly with user inputs and display results accurately.
